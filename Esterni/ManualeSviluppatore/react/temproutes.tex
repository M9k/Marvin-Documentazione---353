	\subsection{Routes}Marvin is made as a single page application (SPA), so basically we have only one web page which is index.html, the rest is all managed by Javascript code, also the page navigation is managed with Javascript libraries like react-dom-router. We made one router component and many routes components (one for every user type). Using Abstract Factory pattern is decided when and which routes component to use; so if the user is a public is used public routes component, and if the user is registered, is used specific routes component for that user and the respective web interface is loaded. \\
	The following UML diagram shows the router and routes components connections using Abstract Factory pattern.
