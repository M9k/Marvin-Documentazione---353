	\subsection{Ducks}
	To keep our app as simple as possible, we decided to use a modular approach to describe all the logical components.\\
	With Redux, we opted to use Ducks\footnote{\nURI{https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux}}.\\
	Ducks is a proposal for bundling reducers, action types and actions in a single file. To have the possibility to extend and reuse our ducks, we decided to use extensible-duck\footnote{\nURI{https://github.com/investtools/extensible-duck}} implementation.
