	\section{Router and Routes} Marvin is made as a single page application (SPA), so basically we have only one web page which is \textit{index.html}, the rest is all managed by Javascript code, also the pages navigation is managed with Javascript libraries like react-dom-router. We made one router component and many routes components (one for every user type). Using Factory pattern is decided when and which routes component to use; so if the user is a public is used a public routes component, and if the user is registered, is used a specific routes component for that user and the respective web pages are loaded. \\
	The following UML diagram shows the router and routes components connections using Abstract Factory pattern.
