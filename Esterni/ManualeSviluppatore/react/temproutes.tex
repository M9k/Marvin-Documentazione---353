	\section{Router and Routes} Marvin is made as a single page application (SPA), so basically we have only one web page which is \textit{index.html}, the rest is all managed by JavaScript code, also the pages navigation is managed with Javascript libraries like react-dom-router. We made one router component and many routes components (one for every user type). We used the  Factory pattern to decide which routes component to use and when, so if the user is public, a public routes component is used, and if the user is registered, a specific routes component for that user is used and the respective web pages are loaded. \\
	The following UML diagram shows the router and routes components connections using the Factory pattern.
