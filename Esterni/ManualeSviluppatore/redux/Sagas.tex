	\subsection{Sagas}
	Redux-saga is a redux library that aims to make application side effects. We use it to do asynchronous calls, for example to fetch data.\\
	It is also a redux middleware, which means that a saga can be started, paused and cancelled with redux actions, that it has full access to redux's state and that it can dispatch redux actions.\\
	Our sagas work with generators, javaScript functions that can provide for functions that can provide for asynchronous flow. We tried to keep our sagas divided into the ducks components of our application
