	\subsection{Ducks-Sagas connection}
	As mentioned above, we tried to keep our sagas divided into the ducks components of our application.\\
	Almost all our sagas are connected with a single duck. After the data fetching, a saga could call the connected duck's actions, for example to set a list in the store.
	In the UML diagram below aren't shown the Duck and Saga interfaces, for more readability.
