	For making the front-end architecture we used the atomic design. Atomic design is methodology for creating design systems. There are five distinct levels in atomic design:
	\begin{enumerate} 
		\item \textbf{Atoms:} are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are the most basic components, such as a form label, an input or a button;
		\item \textbf{Molecules:} are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound;
		\item \textbf{Organisms:} are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface;
		\item \textbf{Templates:} consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages;
		\item \textbf{Pages:} are specific instances of templates.
	\end{enumerate} 
	 React makes it easy to build UI by dividing into components each part of your front-end views and it's really easy to apply atomic design methodology with React.
	So Marvin is split up in 4 different types of components:
	\begin{enumerate} 
		\item \textbf{Bootstrap Components:} are the atoms components. So they are the basic components of our application;
		\item \textbf{Custom Components:} are the molecules and oraganisms components of Marvin;
		\item \textbf{Page templates and routes:} are the template components of the atomic design. So they stitched together to form the application pages;
		\item \textbf{User pages instances:} are the application pages for different users.
	\end{enumerate} 

	\subsection{Props}
	React components implement a render method that takes as input data and returns what has to be shown.
	Input data that is passed to the component as props and can be accessed via this.props.

	\subsection{State}
	Builds encapsulated components that manage their own state, then composes them to make complex UIs.

	\subsection{Store}
	Only the final components, user page instances, will have a different kind of source of data, being the store.
	The store is handled by Redux with a React-Redux connection plugin.
